sixaxff (six axis force-feedback)
=================================

Note, sixaxff is still under development and is not yet fully
functional.

Provides provides hard real-time control of dynamically scaled two winged
flapping robotic model w/ force (or torque) feedback around two axes. Designed
for studying the dynamics of flapping flight. More specifically this software
controls a two wing robot where each wing of the robot has 3 degrees of freedom
and can be programed to track arbitrary kinematics. During a kinematic outscan
the forces and moments are measured using a six axis sensor. The measured
forces and moments are used for force feedback with repect to two of the robots
axes via a dynamic model.

sixaxff consists of two main components

* sixaxff: a shared library providing RTAI based hard real-time control
  of a dynamically scaled two wing flapping robotic model w/ force
  feedback.

* py_sixaxff: a python ctypes wrapper providing access to the sixaxff
  library from python.

Installation

 * Installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.
